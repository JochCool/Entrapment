# Entrapment
Minecraft Entrapment minigame. Originally created by slicedlime, but upgraded to Minecraft 1.19.2 by JochCool and Kri5t0f.

There are some significant changes to slicedlime's v1.5, most notably that the entire world has been moved up to the new build limit. Additionally, in order to make the gameplay as similar as possible to the Minecraft 1.15 version, the values of the five new gamerules have been set to the opposites of their defaults:

* `universalAnger` is true;
* `forgiveDeadPlayers` is false;
* `freezeDamage` is false;
* `doTraderSpawning` is false;
* `doWardenSpawning` is false.
