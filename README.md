# Entrapment
Minecraft Entrapment minigame. Originally created by slicedlime, but upgraded to Minecraft 1.17 and used for the Entrapment Fan Tournament by JochCool.

Before using this map, you must first fill in the blanks in the [setup function](datapacks/Entrapment/data/entrapment/functions/setup.mcfunction), and then run the function in-game.

Videos of the matches will be uploaded to [JochCool's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6e7oGAoGGk7TU3ycCVlijw). To participate in the tournament, join [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/jQ94NNttvz).

The settings of the map are:

* Round Length: 2 min
* Time Added Each Round: 10 seconds
* Maximum Time Added: 1 minute
* Round Before Danger Time Add: 2 rounds
* Danger Time Added Each Round: 25 seconds
* Minimum Safe Time: 30 seconds
* Friendly Fire: On
* Specators: Locked On Player

In order to make the gameplay as similar as possible to the Minecraft 1.15 version, I put the values of the four new gamerules to the opposites of their defaults:

* `universalAnger` is true;
* `forgiveDeadPlayers` is false;
* `freezeDamage` is false;
* `doTraderSpawning` is false.
