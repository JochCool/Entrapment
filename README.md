# Entrapment
Minecraft Entrapment minigame. Originally created by slicedlime, but upgraded to Minecraft 1.17 by JochCool.

In order to make the gameplay as similar as possible to the Minecraft 1.15 version, I put the values of the four new gamerules to the opposites of their defaults:

* `universalAnger` is true;
* `forgiveDeadPlayers` is false;
* `freezeDamage` is false;
* `doTraderSpawning` is false.
